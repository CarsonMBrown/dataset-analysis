\section*{Overview}
In this practical we are asked to use Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas) to analyse Wikipedia citation data of four languages: German, English, Chinese and Ukrainian.

The raw data of each language is presented in a TSV (tab-separated values) file.

Before starting detailed analysis of each language, verification and pre-processing of the raw data are very important first steps.

After raw data has been read in correctly and cleaned, initial descriptive analysis is performed. Finally, additional analytics are performed to explore the data further.




\subsection*{Base Specifications}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\end{itemize}

\section*{Design}
Analytics take form in modular functions, using pandas dataframe as parameter, and results of analysis are outputted in a series of print statements.

Extension work has been designed similarly as modular functions, runs in series after initial analysis.

\subsection*{Base Specifications}

The minimum requirements of this project were to implement the parts which were currently undefined
to complete

We were specifically asked for the following features:

\subsection*{Base Requirements}

We fully completed all the requirements of the base practical.

Each subsection for the additional requirements includes a bulleted list of
extra features that fit within that difficulty level.

NB: As some requirements build on others, the features listed as the difficulty goes
up may overlap with those listed earlier to make sure that all the features are mentioned,
especially if they were specific to a suggested requirement difficulty.
