\section*{Overview}
In this practical we are asked to use Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas) to analyse Wikipedia citation data of four languages: German, English, Chinese and Ukrainian.

The raw data of each language is presented in a TSV (tab-separated values) file.

Before starting detailed analysis of each language, verification and pre-processing of the raw data are very important first steps.

After raw data has been read in correctly and cleaned, initial descriptive analysis is performed. Finally, additional analytics are performed to explore the data further.

\subsection*{Base Specifications}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\end{itemize}

\section*{Design}
Analytics take form in modular functions, using pandas dataframe as parameter, and results of analysis are outputted in a series of print statements.

Extension work has been designed similarly as modular functions, runs in series after initial analysis.

\subsection*{Base Specifications}

The minimum requirements of this project were to implement the parts which were currently undefined
to complete

We were specifically asked for the following features:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item
    \item
    \item
    \item
    \item
    \item
    \item
\end{itemize}

\section*{Design}

\subsection*{Base Requirements}

We fully completed all the requirements of the base practical.

Each subsection for the additional requirements includes a bulleted list of
extra features that fit within that difficulty level.

NB: As some requirements build on others, the features listed as the difficulty goes
up may overlap with those listed earlier to make sure that all the features are mentioned,
especially if they were specific to a suggested requirement difficulty.

\subsection*{Easy, Medium, and Hard Requirements}
\begin{center} \emph{Easy} \end{center}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Output a table with percentage of records for each identifier type
    \item
    \item Output a table with the number of citations from arXiv by the year of their appearance.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center} \emph{Medium} \end{center}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Find an average number of citations per page
    \item
    \item Output a table with the number of citations from Zenodo by the year of their appearance
\end{itemize}

\begin{center} \emph{Hard} \end{center}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Find first ten most highly cited sources
    \item
    \item
\end{itemize}

\section*{Evaluation}

Overall, we are very happy with the progress and completeness of our solution to both the base and additional requirements.

\section*{Conclusion}

To begin with there was a lack of structure and people worked on the project individually and occasionally pushed to github. We didn't begin our work for several weeks, and once we did begin work, it was in disparate intervals, such that no one in our group was really able to work on the project at the same time due to timezones and individual scheduling of time.

We would have liked to be able to implement all the extensions, but we didn't have the time to make sure everyone would be able to do a similar amount of work while still completing all the extensions.

We would have liked to generate a better way of displaying the data, as textual output is only so good at showing results, especially when the results are so inclined to being displayed via graphical displays such as bar graphs.

\section*{Provenance}

We did not source any code from anywhere and wrote all the code submitted ourselves. We did use examples and guides to figure out our code, but no code was not written by us.
