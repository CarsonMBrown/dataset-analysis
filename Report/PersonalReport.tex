\section*{My Contribution}

For this practical, I did a lot of the initial work on the python code, making one each of the easy, medium, and hard extensions along with about half of the basic submission.

I also wrote most of the comments and did most of the cleanup and organizing of the code.

I also ended up assigning some of the rest of the work and doing organizing to make sure everyone knew what they were doing and when itneeded to be done.

\section{Work As A Team}

I think that we worked fairly well as a team for the most part. In this practical, we had some discrepancies when we were able to work on the practical, which lead to me doing a lot of the work closer to the start of the practical and my partners working more towards the end of the practical.

While my partners both put in a good amount of time, it was closer to the end, which meant that a lot of the inital work was mine, as I needed to set up all the helper functions as well as a little over a third of the actual requirements.
